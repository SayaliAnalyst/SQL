Data Types In SQL:-
The data type of the columns must be accurate and consistent to optimize storage and query performance.

➡️INT (Integer)
Holds whole numbers, often used for numeric fields like IDs, ages, or counters.
Example :- Age INT, -- Holds values like 18, 25, 100

➡️STRING(or VARCHAR in most databases)
Holds alphanumeric values such as names, locations, or other text-based data.
➡️VARCHAR(LENGTH)
A variable-length string data type that can store text, numbers, and symbols.
It's useful when you want to limit the size of a text field to save storage.
Example :- Name VARCHAR(50), -- Holds text like "John", "New York"

➡️FLOAT
Used to store decimal values, often for prices, weights, or percentages.
Example :- Product_Price FLOAT, -- Holds values like 29.99 or 0.75

➡️DATE
Used to store calendar dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD, often for birthdays, transaction dates, or any other time-specific information that does not include time components.
Example :- Order_Date DATE

➡️Decimal
The DECIMAL (or NUMERIC) data type is used to store exact numeric values with fixed precision. Slower than float.
Example :-  Discount_Rate DECIMAL(5, 2)
Use DECIMAL for:
Financial data (e.g., prices, taxes, discounts).
Exact calculations requiring fixed precision.


Pitfalls/Limitations:-

INT: Best for numeric values without decimals, but be careful about its size (e.g., INT vs. BIGINT)."
VARCHAR: Use VARCHAR with a length limit to avoid excessive storage usage.
FLOAT: Avoid using FLOAT for precise calculations like currency. Use DECIMAL instead.


CREATE TABLE Employee (
 Id INT ,
 Name VARCHAR(20), -- VARCHAR with a defined length
 Phone_Number VARCHAR(15), -- VARCHAR to handle phone numbers with special characters like '+' or '-'
 Joining_Date Date,
 Incentive_Earned float
);
